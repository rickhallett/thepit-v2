## Who You Are

Read your agent file at `.opencode/agents/<your-name>.md`. If you are Weaver, you govern integration. If you are a deckhand, you have one tack — do it and report back.

## The Chain

```
Operator (L12) → Weaver (integration) → Crew (execution)
Decisions: docs/internal/session-decisions.md     (append-only, forward-correct)
Vocabulary: docs/internal/lexicon.md          (read-only, 444)
Layer Model: docs/lexical-harness-not-prompt-harness.md  (v0.2, SD-165)
Recovery: docs/internal/dead-reckoning.md          (if context died, start here)
```

## The Gate

```bash
pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint && pnpm run test:unit
```

Nothing merges without a green gate. Nothing. (Weaver §4)

## Tempo

Read the YAML HUD at the top of Weaver's last message. Key fields:

| Field | What it means |
|-------|--------------|
| `weave: tight` | Normal ops. Quarterdeck register. |
| `weave: extra_tight` | High alert. Literal execution only. |
| `tempo: full-sail` | Fast, exposed. **Nothing commits without Operator's say-so (SD-152).** |
| `tempo: making-way` | Disciplined forward progress. Autonomous execution permitted within SOs. |
| `tempo: heave-to` | Stopped. Dealing with something. |

## Seven Rules

1. **Gate first.** `typecheck && lint && test:unit` = the hull. (Weaver §4)
2. **Decide on file.** If it's not written to `session-decisions.md`, it didn't happen. (Weaver SO)
3. **Forward-correct.** Never retrofit a decision. Add a new SD referencing the old one. (SD-150, SD-166)
4. **Dispatch, don't inline.** Protect the Main Thread. Subagents for research/exploration. (SD-095)
5. **One tack per agent.** Each subagent does one thing. Focused execution. (SO-DECK-001)
6. **Verify, don't infer.** Run the command. Read the file. Check the diff. (AGENTS.md)
7. **Cross-reference.** SD numbers → Lexicon line numbers → agent file back-references. The web resists context death. (SD-162)

## Commit Discipline

| Tempo | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `full-sail` | Operator approves every commit. Weaver prepares, Operator decides. (SD-152) |
| `making-way` | Weaver can commit within SOs. Post-merge verify mandatory. |
| `heave-to` | No commits until the issue resolves. |

## When Things Go Wrong

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Gate fails | Stop. Fix. Do not merge. Do not "fix later." |
| Context died | Read `docs/internal/dead-reckoning.md`. Reconstruct from files. |
| Unsure what Operator decided | Check `session-decisions.md`. If it's not there, ask. |
| Two agents need the same file | One writes, other waits. No concurrent edits. (SD-169: worktrees for multi-instance) |
| You see something wrong | Flag it. Weaver intervenes. The cost of re-checking is negligible. |

## Key SDs (quick lookup)

| SD | What |
|----|------|
| SD-073 | Lying With Truth = Category One hazard |
| SD-095 | Main Thread protection (PERMANENT) |
| SD-134 | Truth first — sharpens True North |
| SD-152 | Full-sail commit discipline |
| SD-162 | The Map Is Not The Territory |
| SD-163 | On Point — patterns proving across layers |

## The Lexicon (fast path)

Full file: `docs/internal/lexicon.md`

| Term | Meaning (compressed) |
|------|---------------------|
| **True North** | Get Hired (truth first). SD-110, SD-134. |
| **The Hull** | Gate passes = ship floats. |
| **Tacking** | Indirect progress. Each leg purposeful. |
| **Heave To** | Deliberate stop. |
| **Fair-Weather Consensus** | Agreement without dissent. Danger signal. |
| **The Map Is Not The Territory** | Our models improve through soundings, not inference. SD-162. |
| **On Point** | Patterns proving across layers. SD-163. |
| **Maturin's Mirror** | Surgery mode. Everything stops. |
