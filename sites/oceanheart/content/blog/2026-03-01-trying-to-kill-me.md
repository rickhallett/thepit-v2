The previous post shipped a script that replaces a 33,700-token file with a 1,500-token index. The agent committed it, pushed it, wrote the blog post about it, and said:

> On #407. The code, the title, the footnote. Nothing else.

The human asked one question:

> what's the trigger for the script?

The agent's thinking trace:

```
The Operator is asking what triggers the sd-index.js script
to regenerate the index. Right now... nothing. It's manual.
node bin/sd-index.js. That's a paper guardrail. The very
thing the blog post is about.
```

The agent's response:

> Nothing. It's manual. Which means it's a paper guardrail.

Then it read the post-commit hook, which already runs on every commit, and already says "guardrails, not paper" on line 7. And wired the script in:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# post-commit hook — auto-updates .keel-state with machine-derivable fields.
#
# Updates: head (git SHA), sd (last SD-NNN from session-decisions.md),
#          bearing {work, commits, last} (auto-derived from git state).
# Preserves: bearing.note, true_north, tempo, register, weave, gate, tests.
# Requires: KEEL_OFFICER env var — aborts if not set (guardrails, not paper).
#
# Install:
#   ln -sf ../../scripts/post-commit .git/hooks/post-commit
#
# Uninstall:
#   rm .git/hooks/post-commit

PITKEEL="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/pitkeel/pitkeel"

# Build if needed — silently.
if [ ! -x "$PITKEEL" ]; then
  (cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/pitkeel" && go build -o pitkeel . 2>/dev/null)
fi

# If still not available, skip silently — don't block anything.
if [ ! -x "$PITKEEL" ]; then
  exit 0
fi

# Run state-update. Requires KEEL_OFFICER env var or --officer flag.
# If not set, pitkeel aborts with a descriptive error — guardrails, not paper.
OFFICER="${KEEL_OFFICER:-}"
"$PITKEEL" state-update --officer "$OFFICER" 2>&1

# Regenerate session-decisions index if the full log was touched in this commit.
ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
if git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only HEAD 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'session-decisions\.md'; then
  node "$ROOT/bin/sd-index.js" 2>/dev/null
fi

exit 0
```
