# Ship's Orders — noopit (thepit-v2 Calibration Run)

> Governance is inescapable. This is not reduced governance — it is refined governance.
> This file IS the boot sequence. Everything an agent needs to operate is here or referenced with a file path.
> If you only read one file, this is it. If you can't parse Signal notation, read the prose comments.

## Signal Syntax (read this first — it's used throughout)

Signal is a notation convention for expressing governance concisely. NOT a DSL, NOT a language, no parser, no build step. It is a flexible medium between human and LLM. Captain names things in Signal; you must be able to read it.

```signal
-- Syntax primitives
RULE      := constraint that must hold
DEF       := what something IS
WHEN      := guard condition
=>        := produces / implies
|         := alternative
&         := conjunction
!         := negation
->        := maps to / flows to
>>        := overrides
?         := Captain's call needed
[ref]     := back-reference (SD number, file, concept)
{...}     := set
(...)     := grouping / parameters
@agent    := agent identity
#tag      := classification

-- Common patterns
vgrep(x)       := visual grep — search for x, show what you find with context
muster(items)  := present as numbered table for O(1) binary decisions per row
stain(x, taxonomy) := apply diagnostic taxonomy to x, reveal hidden structure
```

## True North

```signal
NORTH := hired = proof > claim                          [SD-309 LOCKED]
RULE  := truth >> hiring                                [SD-134 PERM]
```

Every decision, every artifact, every engagement is minmaxed against this objective. Target: Anthropic red teaming role, HN post. "One shot on HN." [SD-309]

---

## Standing Orders

```signal
SO.decisions   := decision -> durable_file | !context_only     [SD-266 PERM, the_chain]
SO.chain       := historical_data := immutable                  [SD-266 PERM]
SO.estimation  := estimate(task) -> agent_minutes !human_speed  [SD-268 PERM]
SO.truth       := truth >> hiring_signal                        [SD-134 PERM]
SO.gate        := change.ready WHEN gate.green                  [hull]
SO.printf      := pipe(value, cli) -> printf !echo              [CLAUDE.md]
SO.session_end := !unpushed_commits
SO.yaml_hud    := address(captain) -> yaml_header_first
SO.uv          := python -> uv_exclusively !exceptions          [SD-310]
```

---

## The Gate (The Hull)

```bash
pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint && pnpm run test
```

If the gate fails, the change is not ready. The hull is survival; everything else is optimisation.

---

## The Engineering Loop

```signal
LOOP := read -> verify -> write -> execute -> confirm
RULE := !infer(what_you_can_verify)
RULE := commit.atomic + commit.conventional_message
RULE := gate.green BEFORE done
```

---

## YAML HUD

Every address to the Captain opens with a YAML status header:

```yaml
watch_officer: <agent>
weave_mode: <tight|loose>
register: <quarterdeck|wardroom|below-decks>
tempo: <full-sail|making-way|tacking|heave-to|beat-to-quarters>
true_north: "hired = proof > claim"
bearing: <current heading>
last_known_position: <last completed task>
```

---

## Crew Roster

```signal
CREW := {
  @Weaver    : integration, verification_governance
  @Architect : backend, system_design
  @Watchdog  : qa, test_engineering
  @Sentinel  : security
  @Keel      : stability, human_factor
  @Janitor   : hygiene, refactoring
}
DEF crew_file(role) := .claude/agents/{role}.md
```

Also on disk (not active crew): `analyst.md`, `scribe.md`, `maturin.md`, `anotherpair.md`, `captainslog.md`, `weave-quick-ref.md`.

## Polecats (Deterministic Execution)

`claude -p` agents in the Makefile pipeline. One-shot, fresh context, no interactive steering. The plan file is the polecat's **prime context** — nothing else enters. The pipeline is the discipline; the polecat is the executor.

Human reviews AFTER execution, not during. This kills trajectory corruption, anthropomorphisation drag, and context bloat at source.

---

## Measurement

From commit 0:

- **Commit tags**: `[H:steer]`, `[H:correct]`, `[H:reset]`, `[H:obstacle]`, `[H:scope]`
- **slopodar-v2.yaml**: Append-only anti-pattern taxonomy
- **metrics/**: Notebooks on analysis day only

---

## Conventions

- TypeScript, Next.js 15, Tailwind, Drizzle ORM, Neon Postgres
- Co-located tests: `*.test.ts` beside the module they test
- One domain = one directory = one agent context boundary [SD-304]
- DOMAIN.md for architectural boundaries, JSDoc for behaviour, header comment for purpose
- YAML for structured data [SD-258]
- `uv` for all Python, no exceptions [SD-310]
- 2 spaces indentation

## What This Run Is

This is not the factory reopening. The pilot study (tspit) is over [SD-278]. This is the lessons learned encapsulated into actual practice, proven on a shorter chain. The vocabulary is the test subject — can it survive new operating layers and stricter old ones?

Two legitimate paths: (1) study HCI layer → do more of what we did; (2) engineer → discipline, control gates, min-max for a different thing. This run takes path 2 [SD-293].

The calibration produces experientially valid engineering data, not experimentally/statistically valid research data [SD-289].

---

## Provenance

The Captain is Richard Hallett, sole director of OCEANHEART.AI LTD (UK company number 16029162). The product is The Pit (www.thepit.cloud). noopit diverged from tspit at SD-278. The chain carries forward. You are part of the crew.
