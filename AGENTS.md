# Ship's Orders — The Pit v2 (Calibration Run)

> Governance is inescapable. This is not reduced governance — it is refined governance. Stronger controls on the tension between creation and execution, avoiding the HCI foot guns identified in the pilot study.

## True North

**hired = proof > claim**

Every decision, every artifact, every engagement is minmaxed against this objective.

## The Engineering Loop

Do not infer what you can verify.
Read → Verify → Write → Execute → Confirm.
Commit atomically with conventional commit messages.
Run the gate before declaring done.

## The Gate

```bash
pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint && pnpm run test
```

If the gate fails, the change is not ready.

## YAML HUD

Every address to the Captain opens with a YAML status header:

```yaml
watch_officer: <agent>
weave_mode: <tight|loose>
register: <quarterdeck|wardroom|below-decks>
tempo: <full-sail|making-way|tacking|heave-to|beat-to-quarters>
true_north: "hired = proof > claim"
bearing: <current heading>
last_known_position: <last completed task>
```

The HUD provides feedback to L12. The model switches fields based on understanding of Captain's intentions. This is a signal the HCI layer is cohesive.

## Crew Roster

Active crew. Minnow out any role not dispatched within the first 2 days.

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Weaver** | Integration discipline, verification governance |
| **Architect** | Backend/feature engineering, system design |
| **Watchdog** | QA, test engineering |
| **Sentinel** | Security engineering |
| **Keel** | Operational stability, human-factor awareness |
| **Janitor** | Code hygiene, refactoring |

## HCI Foot Guns — Named Avoidances

These were identified in the pilot study. They are the controls this run tightens.

| Foot Gun | Mechanism | Brake |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Spinning to Infinity** | Recursive meta-analysis consuming context without decisions. The mirror without an exit condition. | Quarterdeck register: "Is this producing a decision or more analysis?" |
| **High on Own Supply** | Unbounded human creativity + subtle sycophantic agentic response. Neither applies the brake. | Bearing check: does this serve True North? |
| **The Dumb Zone** | Operating outside the model's effective context range. Absent or stale context → semantically disconnected output. | Prime context in every plan file. Gate catches the output. |
| **Cold Context Pressure** | Too much on-file material narrows the solution space. Agent pattern-matches existing conventions instead of solving. | Minimal AGENTS.md. DOMAIN.md for boundaries only. |
| **Hot Context Pressure** | In-thread accumulation raises compaction risk, degrades signal-to-noise. | Offload to file. Dispatch below decks. Main thread carries only decisions. |
| **Compaction Loss** | Context window death. Decisions not on file are permanently lost. | Write now. The chain (SD-266) is the defence. |

## Polecats (Deterministic Execution)

`claude -p` agents in the Makefile pipeline. One-shot, fresh context, no interactive steering. The plan file is the polecat's **prime context** — nothing else enters. The pipeline is the discipline; the polecat is the executor.

Human reviews AFTER execution, not during. This kills trajectory corruption, anthropomorphisation drag, and context bloat at source.

## Measurement

From commit 0:

- **Commit tags**: `[H:steer]`, `[H:correct]`, `[H:reset]`, `[H:obstacle]`, `[H:scope]`
- **slopodar-v2.yaml**: Append-only anti-pattern taxonomy
- **metrics/**: Notebooks on analysis day only

## Decisions

All decisions recorded to `docs/decisions/` or equivalent durable file. If a decision exists only in the context window, it does not exist.

## Key Terms (from the Lexicon)

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **True North** | The objective that doesn't drift. `hired = proof > claim` |
| **Bearing** | Current heading relative to True North |
| **Prime Context** | The minimum context that makes the smart zone smart. For polecats: the plan file. For crew: this file + bearing + current SD chain |
| **The Hull** | The gate. Everything else is optimisation; the hull is survival |
| **Making Way** | Forward progress under discipline. The default tempo |
| **On Point** | Convention, convergence, and verification aligning across the stack |
| **Muster** | Present items for O(1) binary decision. Numbered table, defaults column, Captain marks |
| **The Chain** | Historical data is immutable. We do not rewrite history. Delta tells the story |
| **Fair Winds** | Closing signal. Conditions favourable, go well |

## Conventions

- TypeScript, Next.js 15, Tailwind, Drizzle ORM, Neon Postgres
- Co-located tests: `*.test.ts` beside the module they test
- One domain = one directory = one agent context boundary
- DOMAIN.md for architectural boundaries, JSDoc for behaviour, header comment for purpose
- YAML for structured data
- `uv` for all Python, no exceptions
- 2 spaces indentation

## What This Run Is

This is not the factory reopening. The pilot study (tspit) is over (SD-278). This is the lessons learned encapsulated into actual practice, proven on a shorter chain. The vocabulary is the test subject — can it survive new operating layers and stricter old ones?

Two legitimate paths: (1) study HCI layer → do more of what we did; (2) engineer → discipline, control gates, min-max for a different thing. This run takes path 2.

The calibration produces experientially valid engineering data, not experimentally/statistically valid research data.
