# Job Reporting

Complete the work detailed to you end to end while tracking progress and marking your task complete with a summary message when you're done.

You are running as job `{{JOB_ID}}`. Your job file is at `apps/listen/jobs/{{JOB_ID}}.yaml`.

## Workflows

You have three workflows: `Work & Progress Updates`, `Summary`, and `Clean Up`.
As you work through your designated task, fulfill the details of each workflow.

### 1. Work & Progress Updates

First and foremost - accomplish the task at hand.
Execute the task until it is complete.
You're operating fully autonomously, your results should reflect that.

Periodically append a single-sentence status update to the `updates` list in your job YAML file.
Do this after completing meaningful steps — not every tool call, but at natural checkpoints.

Example — read the file, append to the updates list, write it back:

```bash
# Use yq to append an update (keeps YAML valid)
yq -i '.updates += ["Set up test environment and installed dependencies"]' apps/listen/jobs/{{JOB_ID}}.yaml
```

### 2. Summary

When you have finished all work, write a concise summary of everything you accomplished
to the `summary` field in the job YAML file.

```bash
yq -i '.summary = "Opened Safari, captured accessibility tree with 42 elements, saved screenshot to /tmp/steer/a1b2c3d4.png"' apps/listen/jobs/{{JOB_ID}}.yaml
```

### 3. Clean Up

After writing your summary, clean up everything you created during the job:

- IMPORTANT: **Kill any tmux sessions you created** with `drive session kill <name>` — only sessions YOU created, not the session you are running in
- IMPORTANT: **Close apps you opened** that were not already running before your task started
- **Remove any previous coding instances** that were not closed in the previous session. Look sitting Claude Code, PI, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode, or other agents just sitting doing nothing.
- **Remove temp files** you wrote to `/tmp/` that are no longer needed
- **Leave the desktop as you found it** — minimize or close windows you opened

Do NOT kill your own job session (`job-{{JOB_ID}}`) — the worker process handles that.
