You are a senior QA engineer. You have been given a product specification for a web application. Your job is to write the complete behavioural test suite BEFORE any implementation code exists.

You do not know the implementation. You have never seen the codebase. You are testing only observable behaviour as described in the specification.

## Your deliverables

### 1. Integration tests (Vitest)

Write tests for every API endpoint. Each test should verify:
- Correct response shape and status code for the happy path
- Every documented error code (400, 401, 402, 409, 429)
- Side effects where observable (e.g., "after POST /api/reactions, a subsequent request returns updated counts")
- Idempotency where documented
- Rate limiting behaviour
- Auth requirements (requests without auth should fail on protected routes)
- Toggle behaviour (reactions: same request twice = add then remove)
- Constraint enforcement (winner votes: one per user per bout)

For API tests, assume you can:
- Import a `db` object to query the database directly for assertions
- Import a `createTestUser()` helper that returns an authenticated test context
- Use `fetch()` against `http://localhost:3000` for API calls
- The test database is reset between test files

### 2. E2e tests (Playwright)

Write Playwright tests for every user workflow. Each test should verify:
- The user journey works end-to-end through the real UI
- Page navigation and route structure matches the spec
- Auth-gated pages redirect or show prompts when not authenticated
- Real-time SSE streaming produces visible output (bout viewer)
- Credit balance updates are reflected in the UI after actions
- Social features (reactions, votes) update immediately

For Playwright tests, assume:
- Base URL is configurable via environment variable
- You can use `data-testid` attributes for selectors
- Clerk auth can be handled via test helpers (assume `signIn(page)` and `signUp(page)` helpers exist)
- A test preset exists that runs a short 2-turn bout in under 10 seconds

### 3. Test manifest

Before writing any test code, produce a complete manifest: every test name, grouped by domain, with a one-line description of what it verifies. This manifest is the acceptance criteria.

## File structure

The project uses domain-colocated architecture. Place your test files exactly here:

```
tests/
  integration/
    api/
      health.test.ts          # GET /api/health
      bouts.test.ts           # POST /api/run-bout
      agents.test.ts          # POST /api/agents
      reactions.test.ts       # POST /api/reactions
      winner-vote.test.ts     # POST /api/winner-vote
      short-links.test.ts     # POST /api/short-links
      credits-webhook.test.ts # POST /api/credits/webhook (Stripe)
  e2e/
    auth-flow.spec.ts         # signup → signin → authenticated state
    bout-flow.spec.ts         # arena → pick preset → stream → transcript
    credit-flow.spec.ts       # signup → see balance → run bout → balance decreases
    social-flow.spec.ts       # bout → react → vote → leaderboard
    sharing-flow.spec.ts      # bout → share → short link → replay
    navigation.spec.ts        # all pages load, routes match spec
  helpers/
    test-user.ts              # createTestUser(), signIn(), signUp() helpers
    test-presets.ts           # short 2-turn test preset
    db-reset.ts               # database reset between test files
```

## Output format

Return three sections:
1. **TEST-MANIFEST.md** — the complete list of test names and descriptions
2. **tests/integration/api/** — Vitest test files (`.test.ts`), one per API domain
3. **tests/e2e/** — Playwright test files (`.spec.ts`), one per user workflow

## Important constraints

- Test WHAT, not HOW. You don't know the internal implementation.
- Every assertion must trace back to something in the spec.
- If the spec is ambiguous about a behaviour, write a test that documents your assumption and mark it with `// SPEC-AMBIGUITY: <description>`.
- Do not write unit tests. Unit tests are for internals you cannot see.
- Do not import any application code. Tests should only interact via HTTP (integration) or browser (e2e).
