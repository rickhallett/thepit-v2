# SD Chain — Signal Compression Prototype

> Prototype conversion of the full SD chain (SD-001 through SD-312) into Signal notation.
> The verbose version (`docs/internal/session-decisions.md`) is the chain (SD-266, immutable).
> This is a VIEW, not a rewrite.

## Comparison: What Works, What's Lost

### What works well

| Property | Assessment |
|----------|-----------|
| **Scanning speed** | A human can scan 312 SDs in ~3 minutes instead of ~30. The shape of the project is visible. |
| **Phase structure** | Grouping SDs into narrative phases (pre-launch, launch, mirror, broadside, magnum) reveals the arc that's invisible in the flat table. |
| **Status compression** | `[PERMANENT]`, `[STANDING]`, `[PARKED]` carry the same weight in 1 token as the verbose "Standing order — PERMANENT" |
| **Batch compression** | `SD-001..003 := ui_cleanup(...)` collapses 3 trivial SDs into 1 line. The originals were padding. |
| **Back-refs preserved** | `[SD-266]`, `[PERMANENT]`, `[lexicon]` all survive. Cross-referencing chain is intact. |
| **Pattern visibility** | You can SEE the governance recursion (SD-189→SD-190→SD-191) as three lines. In verbose, it's 3 paragraphs of justification that obscure the pattern. |

### What gets lost

| Loss | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Captain's verbatim** | HIGH | SD-130, SD-194, SD-158 contain Captain's exact words — the voice, the emotion, the register. Signal cannot carry this. These are the chain's pearls. | 
| **Narrative provenance** | MEDIUM | Why SD-133 (dismissal) happened, what the red-light failure felt like, the Fawlty Towers cascade of SD-150 — Signal captures the decision, not the story. |
| **Context of discovery** | MEDIUM | How AnotherPair named "Learning in the Wild," how Maturin's Symbol emerged across independent context windows — the mechanism is lost, only the outcome survives. |
| **Parked items & queues** | LOW | Post-merge queues, parking justifications, P-items — operational detritus that has no value post-completion. Signal correctly discards these. |
| **Exact numbers** | LOW | Some precise figures compressed out (e.g., "60 instances across 24 files" → just the decision). Recoverable from verbose version. |

### Compression ratio

| Metric | Verbose | Signal | Ratio |
|--------|--------:|-------:|------:|
| Lines | 597 | 175 | 3.4:1 |
| SDs captured | 312 | 312 | 1:1 (complete) |
| Standing orders visible | scattered | annotated inline | improved |
| Phase structure | implicit | explicit | improved |

### Recommendation

Signal works excellently for the SD chain as a **navigation view** — finding what was decided and when. It does NOT replace the verbose version for **provenance** — the Captain's voice, the narrative of discovery, and the emotional register of key moments (SD-130, SD-133, SD-194) are irreducible.

The right model: Signal SD chain is the index card drawer. Verbose SD chain is the filing cabinet. You scan the index cards; you pull the file when you need the full story.

---

## Iteration Notes

**Iteration 1 (this version):** Phase-grouped, batch-compressed where possible, status annotations inline, back-refs preserved. ~175 lines for 312 SDs.

**Diminishing returns reached:** Further compression would sacrifice readability (e.g., collapsing Phase 3 further would lose the narrative arc of launch→honest layer→dismissal→truth first). The current ratio (3.4:1) is lower than the governance compression (4.5:1) because SDs carry more irreducible content per line — each is a unique decision, not a repeated pattern.

**Not attempted:** Programmatic extraction from verbose → Signal. Would require an SD parser and would itself be governance recursion (SD-190). The manual pass was faster and more accurate.
